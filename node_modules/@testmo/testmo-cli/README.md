# Testmo CLI

The Testmo CLI makes it easy to submit your automated test results to Testmo. It was specifically designed to make it easy to integrate Testmo into your CI/CD and build process, so you can easily send test results.

## Installation

Simply install the package by using NPM (usually installed on most systems already by default):

```
npm install -g @testmo/testmo-cli
